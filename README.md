MySQL JDBC DRIVER REQUIRED
==========================

The Decaf JavaScript interface to MySQL requires the MySQL JDBC driver be installed on your system.

You can download the driver from this URL:
    http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/

The driver is GPL licensed, so including it as part of the base Decaf distribution would make it and
anything built with or for it fall under the GPL license as well.

It is up to you to obtain appropriate licensing from Oracle/MySQL for your needs.

Once you download the driver, copy the .jar file to the appropriate place for your operating system.
For OSX it is:

/System/Library/Java/Extensions/

Or you may add it to the java/ext dir in /usr/local/decaf or wherever your Decaf is installed.
