MySQL JDBC DRIVER REQUIRED

The Decaf JavaScript interface to MySQL requires the MySQL JDBC driver be installed on your system.

You can download the driver from this URL: http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/

The driver is GPL licensed, so including it as part of the base Decaf distribution would make it and anything built with or for it fall under the GPL license as well.

It is up to you to obtain appropriate licensing from Oracle/MySQL for your needs.

You may copy the .jar file to this directory.
